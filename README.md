# A Covid-19 website
A basic website for Covid-19 dashboard using the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web application framework and providing free api with telegram bot integration!
## Covid-19 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is first identified in Wuhan,
China. Symptoms of COVID-19 are cough, fever, fatigue, breathlessness, loss of senses of smell
& taste. Persons affected by the virus tend to show the symptoms between one to fourteen days
after being affected. As per the records, most of the people have mild symptoms, some people
develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Long term damage to organs like lungs,
heart are observed. It is mainly spread through small droplets of an infected person breath,
sneezes, cough which are carried through the air. It can also spread through contact with the
people with surfaces containing samples of the people infected with the virus. The virus spread is
so rapid that it can affect the people in contact with the infected person way before he\she show
symptoms. People having high immunity may not show the symptoms of the virus but they
spread the virus to the remaining people around them.
People can prevent the spread of the virus by taking simple measures like covering their nose,
mouth by using masks, face shields, frequently washing their hands with hand wash or sanitizer,
sanitizing the surfaces before getting contact with them, boosting their immunity by consuming
foods rich in vitamins and minerals, social distancing, drinking hot water etc. People all over the
world are seriously affected by this pandemic situation and there is a huge loss of life. Spreading
the awareness amongst people about the spread, symptoms of COVID-19 virus, safety measures
to be maintained to avoid the spread of the virus is very important. People should be aware of the
present pandemic situation to get to know the seriousness of the situation and should take
necessary safety measures from getting affected by the virus.


## The motive of this project:
The best way to prevent and slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 virus is by educating
and spreading awareness amongst the people about it. This is an open-source project, in this, we
have gathered data, made visualizations and presented the analysis regarding the COVID-19
epidemic. We have considered the struggle of the data analysts to share the information about the
COVID-19, so we utilized this project to aid in the sharing of data and information by providing
APIs. This project aims to offer an accessible way for data professionals to share dashboards
without requiring any expertise in front end development by dynamically acquiring and
uploading the data.

## Data Source for the project:
The data source for our project is provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. The main reason for obtaining the data from them is they
provide the data for free of cost and they also provide authenticated data source as they pool the
information regarding the number of COVID-19 cases registered, number of recoveries, number
of deaths from authenticated and reliable sources like World Health Organization (WHO),
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) etc. 
## [Thanks for CSSEGISandData for providing COVID-19 Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

A running instance of it can be found at "

## The framework used: Flask
Flask is a micro web framework written by using Python. It is classified as a microframework
because it doesn't require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer or any
other components where preexisting third-party libraries provide common functions. Flask
supports extensions that can add application features.

# :octocat: How to contribute?

All contributions are welcome! Code, documentation, graphics or even design suggestions are welcome; use GitHub to its fullest. Submit pull requests, contribute tutorials or other wiki content -- whatever you have to offer, it would be appreciated!

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on contributing.


### Application deployment platform: Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. It
supports programming languages such as Ruby, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Scala, Clojure and
Go. It is a polyglot platform for the developer to build, run and scale an application similarly
across most languages. It provides the base platform server, network resources to publish
applications. All the applications that are run on Heroku have a unique domain used to route
HTTP requests to the correct application container/dyno.

Read [Heroku's Flask deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o#deploy-your-application-to-heroku) to learn how to deploy this application there.
